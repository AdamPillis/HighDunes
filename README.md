## 1. **Introduction**

### **What is HighDunes Golf Club?**
HighDunes Golf Club is a golf web application designed for site users to interact with one another as well as the golf club itself. Other than a minimum age requirement of 16, no other requirements are needed to make full use of all features for any potential golfer.
HighDunes Golf Club offers.
- Site users are given the ability to create an account with ease (only username and password required) which automatically allows them to start interacting with some features such as *responding to reviews within the landing page*.
- Create a **once-off** profile which is going to be used from there onwards to create tee bookings only within several clicks.
- Once a profile is set up, the site user is given the ability to proceed with a booking by requesting as many as they wish within several clicks only, as long as they are signed in.

HighDunes Golf Club web application is an imaginary golf club i.e. it does not exist. However, the **Project Aim** was to design an interactive website to show the potential of online presence for a golf club of any size, no matter how popular it is. The developer of this application has researched smaller golf clubs and how they present themselves online, collect data and interact with their users. His findings identified a lack of strong online presence. Most clubs only offer user interactivity via social media websites rather than creating their own online presence through which they could enhance business growth and collecting data which they could use to create marketing strategies and understand their potential target market.

For this reason, the developer decided to create an imaginary website which shows off the power of online presence which is becoming a **must** feature for any business with the potential of increasing business growth. 

 ### **How it works?**

 1. The landing page offers a large, appealing image and a welcome message to the user as soon as they reach the website with a *Sign Up Button* to start interacting. On average, it takes three seconds for a user to decide whether they will stay on the site or leave so this has been taken into account as a result and this landing image has almost been designed to fill full view length. 

 2. Given the developers knowledge of golf, he is fully aware of what potential customers are looking for when researching a golfing site. So therefore, the landing image is followed by more photos and short paragraphs which explain the most important features that the golf club offers. The club does not need to look 5 star in reality given that photos of any quality can be resized and styled to look appealing to the eye. 

 3. After all of the features are explained briefly, the developer implemented an interactive section where users can view reviews and respond by liking, disliking them and even replying to them. The only requirement to start using this feature is just to create an account. No need for a profile.

 4. This is followed by another section where the background image represents a regular image of a golf course in style and another opportunity to *sign up as a user*.

 5. Once the user signs up, they are given the ability to create a profile which is only needed once and can be updated by them at any point. This can be reached via the *navigation bar* or if by mistake, they decide to book a tee time, they will be informed that a profile needs to be created before moving on. 

 6. Profiles do not require approval, however, when it comes to making a tee time, users will need to wait for approval but users are notified of this once they submit their *tee booking request*.

 7. In terms of a user profile, users are only given the ability to create, view and update their profile without approval. In terms of golf bookings, they are given full **CRUD** functionality given that they can create, view, update and delete their approved tee times without contacting the golf shop. 

  ### **Who is it for?**

  Ireland is one of the most popular golfing destinations. With over 220 golf courses and global target audience of 66 million golfers, the potential for business of a golf course of any size is big. Of course, in order to reach a global target market, online presence is almost becoming a *requirement*. International players will want to check out a particular golf they wish to play during their stay so it is important to provide them with essential features such as reviews and golf course features so they can plan ahead and request tee times with special requirements, if any. 

  **New Users**

  New Users are given the ability to create an account by filling in the username and password section only. Entering an email is optional. Once an account is created by the user, they can proceed to create a profile which only needs to be done **once** and does not contain more than 6 fields. Once complete, they can process and book tee times of any amount of their choice and without needed to fill out personal details again. The booking process only requires several fields to be filled in also.
  *New Users* do not need to go further than creating an account in order to start interacting with the site. They can like, dislike and comment under reviews without needing personal details. 

  **Returning Users**

  As a returning user with a profile already set up, the only requirement before proceeding with a booking or checking the status of a booking is to *log in* and click on *My Bookings*.
